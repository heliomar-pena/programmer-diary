# About me

FrontEnd Developer with more than 3 years of experience, specializing in technologies such as ReactJS, Storybook, TailwindCSS, SASS, Express and PostgreSQL. Just started this project that I decided call "programmer's diary" where I will publish tips frequently about the world of development. The idea is make this space like a diary where I can talk about my experiences, my findings, my opinion about certain things, no matter if those aren't unrelevant for most of people, because it is just my space. And at this way, I could probably reach someone who needs it and help him in any way.

However, if you're developer or just are reading this by curious, I hope your travel for the world of development was really good, and the market and the community of developers give you the same you give them.

In case you are curious and want to know more about me you can take a look to some open source projects I have:

- [i18n Populator](https://github.com/heliomar-pena/i18n-populator)
- [i18n Populator Landing NextJS](https://github.com/heliomar-pena/i18n-translate-generator-frontend)
- [i18n Popualtor Landing JS Vanilla](https://github.com/heliomar-pena/i18n-translate-generator-frontend)

Thanks for reading, hope you found any information in this site useful for your projects or your live.
